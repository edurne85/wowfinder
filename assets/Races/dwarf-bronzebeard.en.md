## Bronzebeard Dwarf (Ironforge, Dun Morogh)

Uses the [standard dwarf profile from Pathfinder](http://legacy.aonprd.com/coreRulebook/races.html#dwarves), with the following exceptions and changes:

**Stoneform**: once per encoutner, a Bronzebeard Dwarf can switch to Stoneform for one round. Activating this ability removes any poison, disease, spell, and/or bleeding; and while in Stoneform the creature cannot move, can't take any form of damage, and is immune to any petrification effect.

**Languages**: Bronzebeard Dwarves speak Dwarvish and Common. Dwarves with high intelligence score can select their bonus languages from among these: Gnomish, Darnassian, Thalassian, Draenic, Pandaren.

**Alignment**: Bronzebeard Dwarves are often Lawful Good.
