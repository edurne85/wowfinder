**Restricted usage**: This race has been designed for NPCs and includes traits rarely found among playable races. It's up to the GM whether to allow it for PCs.

**Type**: Humanoid (elf, undead)

**Gender**: Banshees are inherently female. The male equivalent is known as Spectre (under construction).

**Languages**: Banshees speak either Thalassian or Darnassian, depending on their background. Banshees with high Intelligence scores can select their additional languages from among these: Common, Thalassian, Darnassian, Gutterspeak, and Shath'Yar.

**Undead creature**: Banshees have a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against any illness and mind-altering effects. In addition, due to having the *undead* subtype, positive energy effects (Hl, Nt) harm them and negative energy (Sh) heals them.
