# Human (Stormwind, Elwynn Forest)

Uses the [standard human profile from Pathfinder](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/races.html#humans), with the changes described below:

**Ability scores**: In addition to the free choice of +2 boost, all Stormwind humans get an additional +2 to their Charisma (it is perfectly valid to assign the free boost on Charisma to get a total of +4).

**Gregarious**: When members of this race successfully use Diplomacy to win over an individual, that creature takes a â€“2 penalty on attempts to resist any of the member's Charisma-based skills for the next 24 hours.

**Alignment**: Stormwind humans are typically lawful and/or good.
